// Best-case Complexity: O(log(n))
// Worst-case Complexity: O(log(n))
// Average-case Complexity: O(log(n))

// Justification: Because we are throwing out half of our search each time, the operational cost will increase by about half relative to the increase in the size of the input, so the complexity will be logarithmic.
