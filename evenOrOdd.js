// Best-case Complexity: O(1)
// Worst-case Complexity: O(1)
// Average-case Complexity: O(1)

// Justification: Input size for function can only be one value. The size of the value does not impact the number of operations, because we are simply doing a mathematical computation so Big O will be constant O(1).
