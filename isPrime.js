// Best-case Complexity: O(1)
// Worst-case Complexity: O(n)
// Average-case Complexity: O(n)

// Justification: The value of n dictates the operational cost. For instances if the number is a decimal or less than 2 then it will immediately return false, where as for whole numbers greater than 2, it will iterate through the for loop until it determines that it is prime or not giving it a worst and average complexity of linear (O(n)).
