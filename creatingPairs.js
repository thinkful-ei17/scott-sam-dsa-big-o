// worst case: O(n^2) Polynomial (Quadratic)
// average case: O(n^2) Polynomial (Quadratic)
// best case: O(n^2) Polynomial (Quadratic)  This apparently is O(n) because the second loop doesn't run if there is only one number

// justification:  

// In order to fully run this algorithym, you must loop through the entirety of both the outer array and the inner array.
//Therefore, the worst, the best, and the average cases are all the same.  Since there are two loops (that are nested), the complexity is quadratic: O(n^2).
