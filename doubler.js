// Best-case Complexity: O(n)
// Worst-case Complexity: O(n)
// Average-case Complexity: O(n)

// Justification: No matter how large the input array is you have to manipulate every position of the array by multiplying it by two. This means that the best-case, worst-case and average-case complexity are all linear -- O(n). As the input array gets longer, the funtion will take longer proportional to the increase in the size of the input array.
